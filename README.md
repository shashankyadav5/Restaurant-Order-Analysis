I am thrilled to share the details of my latest SQL project on restaurant order analysis. In this project, I dived deep into customer data to gain valuable insights into the new menu's performance.
Project Objectives:
Explore the Menu: Analyzed the menu_items table to get a comprehensive understanding of the new menu offerings.
Understand Order Details: Examined the order_details table to capture the data being collected on customer orders.
Customer Reaction Analysis: Combined insights from both tables to gauge how customers are reacting to the new menu items.
ðŸ”¹ Identified which menu items are performing well and which are not meeting expectations.
 ðŸ”¹ Discovered top customer preferences, providing crucial insights into what the most loyal customers love.
This analysis is instrumental in making data-driven decisions to optimize the menu, enhance customer satisfaction, and ultimately drive business growth.
I am excited to continue leveraging my SQL skills to deliver actionable insights and contribute to impactful business strategies.
